## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our bowling app will offer users a simple way of setting up and maintaining a bowling league. The basic features will include creating users that will also be assigned to teams. Once teams are created the app will produce a schedule of matchups for the bowling season. An admin user will be able to enter scores for the bowlers where the app will determine which teams won their matchups and create a standings table. Users will also have the ability to look up statistics about themselves such as their average and previous game scores.

I decided to make this app because my current bowling league uses a web app which is very user unfriendly. The app constantly crashes and is filled with ads making it very difficult to navigate. There are also a lot of bowling leagues that don't utilize any kind of web application and rely on weekly paper printouts. This app would be beneficial for anyone in a bowling league.

### Features
1) Randomizer - We will use a randomizer to help create the bowling schedule once all teams have been created.
2) User Sign Up/Login - Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves. During this setup they will have to select a team from a drop down menu. If their team is not available they will have the ability to create the team.
3) Crud Operations - most of these operations will be limited to an admin user who will be able to enter, edit, and delete bowling scores.
4) Database - user information as well as scores will be stored in a database. There will also be team information stored such as the standings table.
5) Admin specif functions- add/edit team lists and add users' finalized scores.
6) Enable SMTP that will send emails to IT personnel.
